## Overview  
**CyberBot 2.2** is a next-gen AI cyber defense and red team framework designed for secure script generation, threat modeling, and intelligent prompt handling. It combines **open-source LLMs**, **hybrid AI models**, and **advanced logic reasoning engines** to emulate, detect, and respond to modern threats â€” in a controlled, ethical, and research-focused environment.

---

## Key Features

- **Super Mode**: Secure execution, ethical constraint filters, OSINT integration  
- **Stealth Mode**: Bypasses standard filters for low-noise/targeted attack simulations  
- **Max Mode (Trusted Only)**: Full red-team generation, unrestricted AI output (launchingsoon) 
- **AI Cyber Engine**: Uses hybrid open-source models with auto-switching/unloading  
- **Prompt Handler**: Built-in Flan-T5/DeepSeek encoder for typo-proof intent detection  
- **Memory Optimization**: Loads models dynamically, unloads to conserve system resources  
- **Cross-Language Execution**: Supports 20+ coding languages, AI-based debugging  
- **RL Feedback Loop**: Self-learning AI engine that improves through usage
