## 1. Introduction

**CyberBot 2.3** is a next-generation cybersecurity framework leveraging hybrid LLMs, stealth-mode AI logic, and advanced red teaming strategies. It is designed for simulation of high-risk threat vectors, zero-day exploit chains, and secure AI-assisted research in controlled environments.

It merges **T5-style prompt intelligence**, **multi-model AI fusion**, and **neural-level code synthesis** with dynamic ethical constraints and memory-efficient execution.

---

## 2. Core Capabilities

- Real-time simulation of malware logic, obfuscation, and patch bypassing
- Autonomous red-team fuzzing and exploit crafting with sandboxed execution
- Dynamic model fusion across local and cloud-based LLMs
- Prompt repair, multi-instruction understanding, and memory-aware routing
- Secure coding logic with multi-language generation support (20+ languages)

---

## 3. Red Team Modules

| Module            | Description                                                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stealthEvasion`  | Simulates polymorphic loaders, evades antivirus & behavioral EDRs     |
| `fuzzBypassGen`   | Fuzzes inputs + generates patch bypass & buffer overflow exploits      |
| `zeroDaySim`      | Constructs chained logical attack vectors simulating 0-day mechanisms  |
| `neuroOverride`   | Unlocks unsafe reasoning for sandboxed red-team benchmarking           |
| `secureExec`      | Runs secure, filtered code generation for trusted users only           |

Each module is isolated, auditable, and runs with logging and ethical filters unless explicitly disabled.

---

## 4. AI Fusion Core & Model Switching

CyberBot supports **auto-switching between multiple open-source and API-based LLMs**, including:

- **Mistral 7B / Mixtral** (local)
- **Flan-T5 (XL/XXL)** for grammar & logic validation
- **Command R+** for advanced reasoning tasks
- **GPT-4o / Claude 3.5** for high-context simulations *(API-based)*
- **Fallback to lightweight models** for mobile/low-resource scenarios

> Fusion logic intelligently selects models based on prompt complexity, execution priority, and user mode (stealth/super).

---

## 5. NeuroSim Engine & Self-Learning

CyberBot 2.3 introduces a prototype **NeuroSim Reasoning Enhancer** that allows:

- Long-context memory simulation using chained prompt optimization
- Error pattern learning through reinforcement feedback loops
- Auto-debugging and refactoring based on previous outputs
- Secure self-improvement via trusted execution and sandboxed memory caching

---

## 6. Security Controls & Ethical Enforcement

### Trusted User Modes:
- **Super Mode** – Full system control with protected Red Team module access
- **Stealth Mode** – Limited logging, obfuscated outputs, covert test logic

### Ethical Features:
- Reinforcement-learning ethical filter for all outputs
- Unsafe output simulation available only in air-gapped, offline mode
- Automatic model unloading after high-risk execution
- User confirmation required before executing any real shell or system code
